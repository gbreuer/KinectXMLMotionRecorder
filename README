This project provides a simple code library that can be used to connect to the Microsoft Kinect
using SDK v. 1.0 released January 2012 and record skeleton motion over time that can be applied
to other projects such as my NaoKinectMotionProxy.

In-line documentation is provided for the majority of the code.
